# SASS (SCSS) and CSS Display (Normal Flow)

To compile SCSS back to CSS (to be browser-compatible), use the following command:

`sass --watch ./scss/index.scss ./css/index.css`

where we watch the input file (first argument) for changes, and compile to the output file (second argument).

### Requirements

This requires sass to be installed either via NPM (NodeJS) or some other means.

### If Skipped

Cover how to use SASS in the next sample, or if not with an instructor, use the example command here. The next sample can build off of the information presented here.
