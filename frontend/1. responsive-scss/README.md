# SASS (SCSS) and Responsive Design With Flex

To compile SCSS back to CSS (to be browser-compatible), use the following command:

`sass --watch ./scss/index.scss ./css/index.css`

where we watch the input file (first argument) for changes, and compile to the output file (second argument).

### Requirements

This requires sass to be installed either via NPM (NodeJS) or some other means.
